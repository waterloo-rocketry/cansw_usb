### AStyle configuration options ###

# Waterloo Rocketry does not enforce a team-wide style guide, but we do
# ask that all codebases remain internally consistent. If you change
# the options in this file, please rerun the formatter on all source
# files using `./format.sh -a`

# Documentation for AStyle and a description of what all options do
# is at http://astyle.sourceforge.net/astyle.html.

# Put opening braces on a new line after function headers, like this:
#   int sqr(x)
#   {
style=kr
indent=spaces=4

# Indent case statements from parent switch
indent-switches

# In do-while loops, while appears on same line as the closing bracket:
#   } while (x > 10);
attach-closing-while

# a=2 becomes a = 2
pad-oper

# foo(a,b,c) becomes foo(a, b, c)
pad-comma

# if(x) becomes if (x). Same for while, for, etc.
pad-header

# When declaring pointers, do "char *c", not "char* c". This is to
# reduce ambiguity. "char* a, b, c" looks like it's declaring 3 char
# pointers, but it's not.
align-pointer=name

# "if (x) { y(); }" should be on 3 lines, not 1
break-one-line-headers

# 100 characters is usually enough for any reasonable codebase
max-code-length=100

# When splitting a large conditional across multiple lines, insert the
# linebreak after the || or && rather than before it.
break-after-logical

# Don't excessively indent headers broken into multiple lines:
#
#   if (a < b || c > d)
#
#   becomes
#
#   if (a < b
#       || c > d)
min-conditional-indent=0
